## About
My project is a simple to-do list application. The front end is built using React, utilizing a template link. The backend is developed with Python, employing FastAPI. The application includes the following features:

- Users can create multiple lists by specifying the list name. Each list can contain different items (tasks), with each item having a title, priority (high, medium, low, or none), and due date.

- Accessing the item list of a specific list is achieved by navigating to the list of lists and then clicking on the desired list's name.

- Items can be marked as done by checking their respective checkboxes.
- Filtering options are available within each list based on priority and item status (done or not yet).

- The project contains a dashboard with 4 KPIs:
  - Total number of items (both done and not yet done).
  - Number of items not done.
  - Number of items with a due date and not done.
  - Number of items with high priority and not done.

I tried writing clean and understandable code throughout the project, ensuring readability. I'm looking forward to your feedback!
